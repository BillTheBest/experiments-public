#Folder Description

- **evaluation-impact**: shows the significantly different rankings of classifiers obtained on pre-processing p11 between,respectively, the 4-Fold cross-validation and the 10-Fold cross-validation method.

- **attribute-selection-impact**: shows the significantly different rankings of classifiers obtained, respectively, between pre-processing p11 and p12. Both in case of 4-Fold cross-validation and in case of 10-Fold cross-validation.

- **missing-values-impact**: shows the significantly different rankings of classifiers obtained, respectively, between pre-processing p0 and p2, only on the datasets that contain missing values (30/101). Both in case of 4-Fold cross-validation and in case of 10-Fold cross-validation.

- **pre-processing-impact**: shows the significantly different rankings of classifiers obtained, respectively, between pre-processing p11 and the best pre-processing technique (from p0 to p12). Both in case of 4-Fold cross-validation and in case of 10-Fold cross-validation.
