#Project Descriptions

- **analysePattern**: This project takes as input experiments results obtained through the Tester project, and analyses them to provide a ranking of the evaluated algorithms.

- **findDatesets**: This project can be used to find in which datasets a specific workflow (pi, cj) obtains an accuracy rank=1.

- **PatternWorkflow**: This project can be used to calculate the average rank of the workflows that match a specific data pattern.

- **statisticAnalyzer**: This project checks which factors have a significant impact on the rankings of classifiers. 

- **Tester**: This project tests the performances of some specified classifiers and pre-processing techniques on the dataset to test.
